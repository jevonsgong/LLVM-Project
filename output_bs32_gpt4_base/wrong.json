            "answer": "He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5\nHe earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5\nIt will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12\nHe will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13\n#### 13"

            "answer": "First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years\nThen multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%\nThen multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000\n#### 25000"
