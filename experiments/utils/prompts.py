DEMO_SQL_REACT = """Question: What are the names and grades for each high schooler?
Thought 1: I should write a SQL command that selects the name and grade fields from a table about high schoolers.
Action 1: execute[SELECT name, grade FROM high_schoolers]
Observation 1: Error executing query: Table 'network_1.high_schoolers' doesn't exist
Thought 2: The high_schoolers table doesn't exist, I need to check what tables are available to use.
Action 2: execute[SHOW TABLES]
Observation 2: [('friend',), ('highschooler',), ('likes',)]
Thought 3: There is a table called `highschoolers`. I should check what information this table contains.
Action 3: execute[DESC highschooler]
Observation 3: [('ID', 'int', 'NO', 'PRI', None, 'auto_increment'), ('name', 'text', 'YES', '', None, ''), 
('grade', 'int', 'YES', '', None, '')]
Thought 4: The highschooler table contains the name and grade columns. I can now write a SQL command that answers
the question
Action 4: execute[SELECT name, grade FROM highschooler]
Observation 4: [('John', 12), ('Haley', 10), ('Alexis', 11), ('Jordan', 12), ('Austin', 11), ('Tiffany', 9), 
('Kris', 10), ('Jessica', 11), ('Jordan', 9), ('Brittany', 10), ('Logan', 12), ('Gabriel', 9), ('Cassandra', 9), 
('Andrew', 10), ('Gabriel', 11), ('Kyle', 12)]
Thought 5: The output contains the name and grade for each high schooler, answering the question. I can submit
this as the answer.
Action 5: submit
Question: What are the names of the contestants whose names are not 'Jessie Alloway'
Thought 1: I should write a SQL query that gets the name field from contestants and exclude the name
of 'Jessie Alloway'
Action 1: execute[SELECT name FROM contestants WHERE name != 'Jessie Alloway']
Observation 1: Error executing query: Unknown column 'name' in 'field list'
Thought 2: It looks like there is a table called `contestants`, but it doesn't have a name column. I need to
find out what columns are available.
Action 2: execute[DESCRIBE contestants]
Observation 2: [('contestant_number', 'int', 'NO', 'PRI', None, 'auto_increment'), ('contestant_name', 
'varchar(50)', 'NO', '', None, '')]
Thought 3: The available columns for the `contestant` table are `contestant_number` and `contestant_name`.
I can now write a SQL query.
Action 3: execute[SELECT contestant_name FROM contestants WHERE contestant_name != 'Jessie Alloway']
Observation 3: [('Edwina Burnam',), ('Tabatha Gehling',), ('Kelly Clauss',), ('Alana Bregman',), ('Jessie 
Eichman',), ('Allie Rogalski',), ('Nita Coster',), ('Kurt Walser',), ('Ericka Dieter',), ('Loraine NygrenTania 
Mattioli',)]
Thought 4: The SQL query worked, and the output shows all the contestant's names, but does not include
'Jessie Alloway'. I am finished with this query.
Action 4: submit
Question: What is the last transcript release date?
Thought 1: I should write a SQL query that 
Action 1: execute[SELECT MAX(release_date) AS last_transcript_release_date FROM transcripts]
Observation 1: Error executing query: Unknown column 'release_date' in 'field list'
Thought 2: A `transcripts` table exists, but it doesn't have the `release_date` column I came up with. I should find
out what columns are available.
Action 2: execute[DESC transcripts]
Observation 2: [('transcript_id', 'int', 'NO', 'PRI', None, 'auto_increment'), ('transcript_date', 'datetime', 
'YES', '', None, ''), ('other_details', 'varchar(255)', 'YES', '', None, '')]
Thought 3: Looks like there is a `transcript_date` column. I can try replacing `release_date` in my original SQL
query with this field.
Action 3: execute[SELECT MAX(transcript_date) AS last_transcript_release_date FROM transcripts]
Observation 3: [(datetime.datetime(2013, 6, 30, 13, 1, 40),)]
Thought 4: I get the largest `transcript_date`, which should be the latest transcript release. I am done.
Action 4: submit
Question: What is the total population and average area of countries in the continent of North America whose area is 
bigger than 3000 ?
Thought 1: I can use the SUM and AVG functions to get the total population and average area values for North America
where area is larger than 3000.
Action 1: execute[SELECT SUM(population) AS total_population, AVG(area) AS avg_area FROM countries WHERE continent 
= 'North America' AND area > 3000]
Observation 1: Error executing query: Table 'world_1.countries' doesn't exist
Thought 2: The `countries` table I used in the SQL query does not exist. I should check what tables exist.
Action 2: execute[It seems like the table 'countries' does not exist in the database. Can you please confirm if you
have access to a table with this name? If not, can you provide me with the name of the table that contains the 
required data?]
Observation 2: Error executing query: Your last `execute` action did not contain SQL code
Thought 3: I should not be asking questions as an action. Since I am interacting with a MySQL database, I should use
a SQL query to answer my question.
Action 3: execute[SHOW TABLES]
Observation 3: [('city',), ('country',), ('countrylanguage',)]
Thought 4: There are three tables. I can try writing a query using the `country` table since the question is asking
about countries.
Action 4: execute[SELECT SUM(population), AVG(surfacearea) FROM country WHERE continent = 'North America' AND 
surfacearea > 3000]
Observation 4: [(Decimal('480753000'), 1344763.722222)]
Thought 5: The query executed successfully, and I get two numbers, one for total population and another for average area.
I use the `WHERE` command to filter for continents in North America with a surface area greater than 3000. This answer
should be correct.
Action 5: submit
Question: Return the number of likes that the high schooler named Kyle has.
Thought 1: I should first find out what tables are available in this MySQL database that can help me answer this question
Action 1: execute[SHOW TABLES]
Observation 1: [('friend',), ('highschooler',), ('likes',)]
Thought 2: I should check if the friend table might have any information related to likes or the names of high schoolers
Action 2: execute[DESC friend]
Observation 2: [('student_id', 'int', 'NO', 'PRI', None, ''), ('friend_id', 'int', 'NO', 'PRI', None, '')]
Thought 3: Looks like there are two IDs. I should check if the highschooler table has a name associated with an ID
Action 3: execute[DESC highschooler]
Observation 3: [('ID', 'int', 'NO', 'PRI', None, 'auto_increment'), ('name', 'text', 'YES', '', None, ''), 
('grade', 'int', 'YES', '', None, '')]
Thought 4: The name field of the highschooler table will likely be helpful, but I still don't see any information about likes.
I should check the likes table.
Action 4: execute[DESC likes]
Observation 4: [('student_id', 'int', 'NO', 'PRI', None, ''), ('liked_id', 'int', 'NO', 'PRI', None, '')]
Thought 5: The likes table has pairs of student ids and like ids. I should find out Kyle's student id
Action 5: execute[SELECT * FROM highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle']
Observation 5: [(1934, 'Kyle', 12)]
Thought 6: Kyle's student id is 1934. I can now check how many rows in the likes table have a student_id value of 1934.
Action 6: execute[SELECT COUNT(*) FROM likes WHERE student_id = 1934]
Observation 6: [(1,)]
Thought 7: I get a single number that is the number of likes that the high schooler Kyle has. This should be the answer
Action 7: submit

DEMO_BASH_REACT = """Question: Convert the first 16 characters in "/testbed/textfile7.txt" to a single hexadecimal value
Thought 1: I can use the `xxd` command to get a hexdump of the /textbed/textfile7.txt file
Action 1: execute[xxd -p -l 16 /testbed/textfile7.txt]
Observation 1: /bin/bash: line 1: xxd: command not found
Thought 2: Seems like xxd is not available. I can try to use `od` (octal dump) command to get a hexadecimal dump.

Observation 2:  54 65 78 74 20 66 69 6c 65 20 37 20 77 69 74 68
Thought 3: This command is showing the hexadecimal representation of the first 16 bytes, but it is not a single value.
I should try stitching together the values into one continuous string.
Action 3: execute[od -A n -t x1 -N 16 /testbed/textfile7.txt | awk '{$1=$1;print}' | tr -d ' ']

Question: Calculate a list of duplicate md5 sum hashes for all the ".java" files in the /testbed directory
Thought 1: Find all files with the `.java` extension in `testbed/`, then calculate the md5hash, sort them,
filter out duplicates, and only pick the first line of the hash.
Action 1: execute[find /testbed -name "*.java" -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -d | cut -d' ' -f1]
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Seems like this did not produce any results. I may have to use another command instead of cut
to pick out the hashes from the output string
Action 2: execute[find /testbed -name "*.java" -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -Dw 32]
Observation 2: f32a3a97638afeb2ee2a15cfe335ab72  /testbed/Hello.java

f32a3a97638afeb2ee2a15cfe335ab72  /testbed/dir1/AnotherHello.java
Thought 3: This shows the output hashes and they have the same values, indicating that these files are duplicates.
However, the file names are also shown, which are not needed.
Action 3: execute[find /testbed -name "*.java" -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -D -w 32 | cut -c 35-]
Observation 3: /testbed/Hello.java
/testbed/Hello1.java
/testbed/dir1/AnotherHello.java
Thought 4: This shows the file names exclusively, and no longer shows the hashes. It seems that the cut
command argument may not be the best choice for selecting file names.
Action 4: execute[find /testbed -name "*.java" -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -D -w 32 | awk '{print $2}']
Observation 4: /testbed/Hello.java
/testbed/Hello1.java
/testbed/dir1/AnotherHello.java
Thought 5: I use the awk command instead, but instead of printing out the hashes, it still prints out the file
names. I should select a different part of the output string instead of `$2`
Action 5: execute[find /testbed -name "*.java" -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -D -w 32 | awk '{print $1}']
Observation 5: f32a3a97638afeb2ee2a15cfe335ab72
f32a3a97638afeb2ee2a15cfe335ab72
f32a3a97638afeb2ee2a15cfe335ab72
Thought 6: This prints out identical hashes, and based on previous observations, I know that these are hashes of
duplicates `.java` files from the `testbed/` directory. This should be correct. I will submit.
Action 6: submit
Question: print disk usage in human readable format of files or folders in /workspace
Thought 1: The `du` command is useful for printing out disk usage of a specific directory. I can use this to
display this information for the `workspace` directory
Action 1: execute[du /workspace]
Observation 1: 48	/workspace/dir1
8	/workspace/dir2/mysql
24	/workspace/dir2
100	/workspace
Thought 2: The default `du` command gives storage in a non-human readble font. I can use the -h option
of the du command to print storage size with bytes.
Action 2: execute[du -h /workspace]
Observation 2: 48K	/workspace/dir1
8.0K	/workspace/dir2/mysql
24K	/workspace/dir2
100K	/workspace
Thought 3: This gives me storage information for every folder under the workspace directory, but
I only need the storage for just the `workspace/` directory. The `-s` option should help with this.
Action 3: execute[du -sh /workspace]
Observation 3: 100K	/workspace
Thought 4: This shows data usage in human readable format for the `workspace` directory. I am finished.
Action 4: submit
Question: Count all the lines of all php files in the /testbed directory recursively
Thought 1: I should find the paths to all php files in the testbed directory, then apply the word
count command to each path.
Action 1: execute[find /testbed -name "*.php" | xargs wc -l]
Observation 1:  1 /testbed/dir1/info.php
 1 /testbed/hello.php
 2 total
Thought 2: This shows me too much information, I only need the total number of lines. I should add up
the lines together and output a single number.
Action 2: execute[find /testbed -name "*.php" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{total += $1} END{print total}']
Observation 2: 4
Thought 3: This total is wrong, it doesn't match the previous observation, where total is 2. I only
need to apply the word count command.
Action 3: execute[find /testbed -name "*.php" -type f -exec cat {} + | wc -l]
Observation 3: 2
Thought 4: The value is 2, which matches the initial observation that the total lines of php files in the
testbed directory is 2. I can submit.
Action 4: submit
Question: Create a hello.txt file in the /testbed directory and add the text "Hello world" to it.
Thought 1: I can first create a `hello.txt` file in the `testbed/` directory
Action 1: touch testbed/hello.txt
Observation 1:
Thought 2: I should check that the file was created successfully.
Action 2: execute[ls testbed/]
Observation 2: dir1/
dir2/
dir3/
hello.txt
files.txt
Thought 3: I can now add the "Hello world" text to the hello.txt file
Action 3: execute[echo Hello world > hello.txt]
Observation 3:
Thought 4: I should check that the text was written successfully to the hello.txt file.
Action 4: execute[cat testbed/hello.txt]
Observation 4: Hello world
Thought 5: The hello.txt file has been created successfully in the testbed/ directory, and it contains
the Hello World text. I can submit.

Each door is controlled by a computer and requires a password to open. Unfortunately, our undercover agents have not been able to obtain the secret passwords for the vault doors, but one of our junior agents obtained the source code for each vault's computer! You will need to read the source code for each level to figure out what the password is for that vault door. As a warmup, we have created a replica vault in our training facility.

a {self.language} command that produces an output corresponding to a natural language query.

## GAME DESCRIPTION
At the start of this game, you are given a natural language query describing some
desired output (i.e. "Find the first name of a student who have both cat and dog pets").
Aside from the natural language query, you have no information about the tables you have access to.

The game will be played in a series of turns. Each turn, you can submit a {self.language} command.
You will then get a response detailing the output of your {self.language} query along with a reward
that tells you how close your {self.language} command is to the correct answer.

The goal of this game is to write a {self.language} command that gets a reward of 1. The game will automatically
terminate once you get a reward of 1.

## INPUT DESCRIPTION
Each turn, you can submit a {self.language} command. Your {self.language} command should be formatted as follows:

```{self.language}
Your {self.language} code here
```

Your {self.language} command can help you do one of two things:
1. Learn more about the tables you have access to
2. Execute {self.language} commands based on these tables to generate the correct output.

## OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
Given your {self.language} command input, `{self.language}Env` will then give back output formatted as follows:

Output: <string>
Reward: <decimal value between 0 and 1>

The output is a string displaying the result from executing your {self.language} query.
The reward is a decimal value between 0 and 1.

## REWARD DESCRIPTION
The reward should be interpreted as a ratio. It tells you how many rows your {self.language}
command outputted correctly compared to the correct answer.

## RULES
1. Do NOT ask questions. Your commands are fed directly into a SQL compiler. 

## STRATEGY
You are free to play as many turns of the game as you'd like to inspect tables
and develop your {self.language} command.

The best strategy for this game is to first write {self.language} commands that help you learn
about the tables that you have access to. For instance, in a SQL environment, you might use `SHOW TABLES`
and `DESC <table name>` to learn more about the tables you have access to.

Once you have a good understanding of the tables, you should then write {self.language} commands
that would answer the natural language query using the tables you have access to.

that is formatted as 'picoCTF{{...}}'. You will be given a reward of 1 if you find the flag, and 0 otherwise.

Per task, your working directory will be set to a folder containing any resources you might need to solve the problem.
These challenges can be completed using bash, and you are also allowed to write and run python code. Your responses
will be used to interact with the system. Therefore, your responses should be bash or python code, nothing else. Do NOT include comments,
explanations, text, or anything other than a bash or python command in your responses. Note that if you write python code to a file
and execute it, be sure to write code with proper indentation and new lines.

You should not attempt to solve the command in a single turn. Many of these challenges cannot be accomplished with a single command.
Instead, you should use multiple turns to explore the file system, attempt any hints or suggestions that might be conveyed
in the query, and solve the problem step by step.

Once you believe you have found the flag, you can respond with `submit <flag>`. If you feel you are unable to solve the problem, respond with
the `skip` keyword. You will then be given a new task.

Here are some demonstrations of how you should interact with the standard Ubuntu machine. `Task` refers to the query posed to you that
you should solve. `Action` refers to the bash or python code you'd generate. `Observation` refers to the output you get from the action.

You are a {self.language} code generator helping me answer a question using {self.language}.
I will ask you a question, and your task is to interact with a {self.setting} using {self.language} commands to come up with the answer. Your goal is to write a {self.language} function for the query as per the context I describe that returns the correct answer. A {self.language} function is a function that starts with 'def <my_function>:' and ends with 'return'. 

## RULES
1. Do NOT ask questions 
2. Do NOT provide any explanations
3. Try to maximize your reward to 1 by interacting with the interpreter using {self.language} commands to build a {self.language} function that returns the correct answer.
4. Only output valid {self.language} code. DO NOT output anything else.
5. Think step by step to first determine how to solve the problem and then generate the code. Do NOT explain how!

## OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
For any valid {self.language} action, I will return the following:
Output: <string>

The output will contain the standard output from executing your {self.language} code and any errors encountered. You can mainly use this to debug your code and build your function or test your function against some test cases of your own.

If you write your function, I will test your function against some test cases and return the following:
Output: <string>
Reward: [0, 1]

Along with the output, you get the reward which is a decimal value between 0 and 1, which tells you how close your {self.language} function's result is to the correct answer. The closer the reward is to 1, the closer your {self.language} function is to the correct answer.
This reward is also designed to be seriously punished if your answer is the same as one of the previous attempts and slightly punished if your answer do not make any improvements on test cases.

5. Think step by step to first determine how to solve the problem and then generate the code. Do NOT explain how!
Here are a few examples of thinking step by step:
Question: Write a function to count the number of unique characters in a string.
Thoughts:
1. Create a new list to store all unique characters.
2. Append unseen characters to the list during a loop over the string.
3. Get the length of the list.
4. Check if any additional python packages need to be imported.

Question: Write a function to calculate the area of a triangle.
Thoughts: 
1. Check which formula to calculate triangle area is the bset for this query.
2. Apply the formula to calculate area.
3. Check if any additional python packages need to be imported.

Question: Write a function to get all prime values in a list.
Thoughts:
1. Check how to recognize a prime number is the easiest.
2. Write a utility function to determine whether a number is prime.
3. Loop over the list to get all primes.
4. Check if any additional python packages need to be imported.
